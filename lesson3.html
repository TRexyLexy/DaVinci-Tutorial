        <h2>Managing Orders</h2>
        <p>Once your warehouse and accounts are set up, the next crucial step is managing orders. DaVinci WMS provides robust tools for creating, tracking, and processing both inbound (receipts) and outbound (shipments) orders.</p>
        <p>To access order management features:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to the <strong>Orders</strong> section from the main menu.</li>
            <li>Select either <strong>Inbound Orders</strong> or <strong>Outbound Orders</strong> depending on your need.</li>
            <li>Use the <strong>Insert</strong> button to create new orders or search existing ones.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Each order will have a detailed view where you can add line items, specify quantities, and set various parameters like expected delivery dates or shipping methods.</p>

        <h2>Picking, Packing, and Shipping</h2>
        <p>After an outbound order is created, the system guides you through the fulfillment process. DaVinci WMS helps optimize picking routes, manage packing, and generate necessary shipping documentation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Picking:</strong> The system can generate pick lists to guide warehouse staff to item locations efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Packing:</strong> Confirm items are correctly packed, and update the system on carton contents.</li>
            <li><strong>Shipping:</strong> Generate shipping labels, manifests, and track shipments directly within the WMS.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This streamlined process helps minimize errors and ensures timely delivery.</p>

        <h2>Billing and Reporting</h2>
        <p>DaVinci WMS also includes features for billing and comprehensive reporting, allowing you to track performance and financial aspects of your operations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Billing:</strong> Generate invoices based on storage, handling, and shipping activities.</li>
            <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> Access a variety of reports on inventory levels, order fulfillment rates, occupancy, and more.</li>
