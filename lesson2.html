    <h1>Lesson 2: Setup and Importing Data</h1>
    
    <p>Setting up a warehouse in DaVinci WMS involves navigating to the "Warehouse Terminal" and clicking the green insert button. When creating a new warehouse, the only mandatory fields are "Description," "Mode," and "Bounded/Unbounded". However, you can fill in additional fields as needed to provide more detailed information. Remember to click "Save" after entering the information, and you can always return to this section to edit your warehouse details later.</p>

    <p>An "account" in DaVinci WMS refers to a client, customer, or any business entity you will be working with. To create a new account, go to "Business Partners," then select "Accounts," and click the green insert button. This will open a new form where you can input the account's details.</p>

<p>DaVinci WMS supports importing various types of data, including products, inventory, and orders, which can significantly streamline your operations. To import data, go to the import screen and select the type of data you wish to upload from the "Import Type" dropdown menu. After selecting the import type, choose your import file. DaVinci also provides a "Download Template" option, which allows you to view a sample file to understand the required format. Once your file is selected, click the blue import button. A critical tip: never import data into a live system without thorough testing.</p>
